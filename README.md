# SportsLink - Overview of the project

**Contextualization in TQS Course:**

This project assignment aims to apply Software Quality Assurance (SQA) and DevOps practices in a real-world, medium-sized software development scenario. The team is expected to implement a full-stack application using Spring Boot, applying an agile methodology with continuous integration, continuous testing, and continuous delivery pipelines. This project demonstrates the integration of quality practices from conception through deployment, including test automation, code analysis, and infrastructure management.

**SportsLink Application Overview:**

SportsLink is a digital marketplace platform that connects field owners with sports enthusiasts who want to rent sports fields and related equipment on-demand. The application solves a critical inefficiency in sports facility utilization: field owners have idle capacity during off-peak hours while potential users lack convenient access to affordable sports facilities.

**What is it good for?**

- **For Field Owners:** Monetize underutilized sports facilities by renting them out, manage bookings and equipment inventory, track maintenance schedules, and monitor occupancy rates.
- **For Renters:** Discover nearby sports fields filtered by sport type, location, and availability; easily reserve fields for specific time slots; access quality assurance information through reviews and ratings.
- **For Platform Administrators:** Monitor platform health, analyze usage metrics, manage user partnerships, and ensure compliance and safety standards.

**Product Name:** SportsLink

**Domain:** Sports facilities and equipment rental platform, initially focused on collective sports (padel, futsal, tennis, badminton, basketball, volleyball, etc.)
