**Name:** Tomás Floro Silva  
**Age:** 20 years old
**Occupation:** university student
**Location:** Aveiro, Portugal  

## Background  
Tomás Floro Silva is a 20-year-old university student from Porto. He is studying Management at the University of Aveiro and, despite being very dedicated to his studies, he has always had a passion for sports, especially football. He grew up playing street football with his friends and, although his classmates don’t share the same enthusiasm, he loves the idea of ​​getting together for a casual game of football. Tomás feels that football is a great way to relieve the stress of studying and strengthen connections with others, but he has trouble finding people willing to play when he is available.

## Daily Life  
Tomás wakes up early, usually around 8am, to prepare for university. He spends most of his day on campus, attending classes and studying in the library, where he spends hours concentrating on his academic work. When he gets home, around 6pm, he likes to relax a bit, whether it’s watching football videos on YouTube or watching live games. He also tries to stay active, going for runs or going to the gym, but he misses playing football as much as he does.

In his free time, like in the evenings or on the weekends, he tries to organize a game with his friends, but often the plans don’t come to fruition because his classmates are busy with other commitments. When this happens, Tomás ends up feeling frustrated and unmotivated, because the urge to play doesn’t go away. He often turns to social media to try to get someone to play, but without much success. However, he wants to find a more efficient way to connect with other people who, like him, are looking for a “game of football”. 

## Goals & Needs  
Tomás wants to find a simple and quick way to connect with people who are also looking for a soccer game. His goal is to find available players and locate fields near his location. He would like to know the quality of the fields, since not all of them offer good conditions for playing the sport. In addition, Tomás wants to be able to check the rating of the fields and other people's opinions, to ensure that the place is suitable for a good match. He is looking for a way to organize these games easily, without depending on the availability of his friends.

## Pain Points & Challenges  
Tomás faces several challenges when it comes to organizing a soccer game. He has trouble finding people willing to play, especially since his college friends are not always available. Social media platforms are not always helpful, since he needs more organization and a specific focus on soccer. Another challenge is the uncertainty about the quality of the available fields: he does not always know which fields are good, safe, and in good condition, or whether they are occupied or not. The lack of an organized platform that centralizes all this information is a major obstacle for Tomás.
## Motivation  

Tomás says: “I just want a place where I can find people willing to play football, without any hassle, and know which pitches are available and in good condition to play on. I love football, but I don’t have time to wait for other people or run the risk of arriving at a pitch and not being able to play because the grass has holes or there are too many people playing. I need something that makes my life easier and helps me play more often.”

Tomás is motivated to use a platform or service that connects him with other people in his city who are also looking for informal football matches, while being able to check the quality of the pitches. He seeks convenience and the satisfaction of being able to practice what he loves, whenever he has time.
