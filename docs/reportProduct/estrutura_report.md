# SportsLink - Product Specification Report


## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Overview of the project

**Contextualization in TQS Course:**

This project assignment aims to apply Software Quality Assurance (SQA) and DevOps practices in a real-world, medium-sized software development scenario. The team is expected to implement a full-stack application using Spring Boot, applying an agile methodology with continuous integration, continuous testing, and continuous delivery pipelines. This project demonstrates the integration of quality practices from conception through deployment, including test automation, code analysis, and infrastructure management.

**SportsLink Application Overview:**

SportsLink is a digital marketplace platform that connects field owners with sports enthusiasts who want to rent sports fields and related equipment on-demand. The application solves a critical inefficiency in sports facility utilization: field owners have idle capacity during off-peak hours while potential users lack convenient access to affordable sports facilities.

**What is it good for?**

- **For Field Owners:** Monetize underutilized sports facilities by renting them out, manage bookings and equipment inventory, track maintenance schedules, and monitor occupancy rates.
- **For Renters:** Discover nearby sports fields filtered by sport type, location, and availability; easily reserve fields for specific time slots; access quality assurance information through reviews and ratings.
- **For Platform Administrators:** Monitor platform health, analyze usage metrics, manage user partnerships, and ensure compliance and safety standards.

**Product Name:** SportsLink

**Domain:** Sports facilities and equipment rental platform, initially focused on collective sports (padel, futsal, tennis, badminton, basketball, volleyball, etc.)

## 2 Product concept and requirements

### 2.1 Vision statement

**High-level Business Problem:**

Sports field owners struggle with capacity utilization and revenue optimization, while sports enthusiasts face barriers to accessing affordable, convenient facilities. The fragmented market has no central platform for discovery, booking, and management—requiring users to contact individual facilities manually or rely on outdated website systems.

**Core Value Proposition:**

SportsLink provides a unified, trust-based marketplace where:

- **Field Owners** gain visibility into market demand, automate booking management, track equipment health, and optimize pricing
- **Renters** discover available facilities through intuitive filtering (by sport, location, price, availability), book instantly, and access relevant equipment for the sport
- **Platform** earns transaction fees while building a trusted sports community

**Key Features (MVP Scope):**

1. **Smart Field Discovery** - Search by sport type, location (proximity), availability, price range, and ratings
2. **Seamless Booking** - Calendar-based reservation with instant confirmation and payment processing
3. **Equipment Management** - Field owners track and update equipment availability and maintenance status
4. **Renter Dashboards** - View active/past bookings, favorites, and booking history
5. **Owner Dashboards** - Manage listings, view occupancy rates, monitor equipment, track earnings
6. **User Profiles & Authentication** - Secure registration, role-based access (owner, renter, or both)
7. **Reviews & Trust System** - Community ratings for facilities, equipment, and users
8. **Platform Analytics** - Admin dashboard with KPIs (active users, bookings, revenue, platform health)
9. **Payment Processing** - Integrated payment gateway (Stripe sandbox for MVP)
